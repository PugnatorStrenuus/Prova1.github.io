                  Roman epigraphy is an intriguing legacy of the Roman civilization.
                  Whereas historiography often focuses on the great men who shaped history, inscriptions, on the other hand, reveal a broader reality. They provide a glimpse into the lives of ordinary people and local communities.
                  The men who commissioned these inscriptions often wanted to immortalize their achievements, taking pride in listing their position and/or the regiment they had served in. With just a few lines, we can reconstruct the history of a person and their life.
                  Ancient Roman inscriptions are usually found in ancient cities, but some can also be found in Venice, even though the city itself was born in the Middle Ages! Why is that?

                  This is a question that many scholars have wondered about. The phenomenon of reuse is very old, but in this case, the shortage of raw materials does not seem to be the main reason. This is suggested by the fact that the inscriptions were often placed in plain sight on the walls of buildings. It’s likely that Venice, lacking the ancient past of many other Italian cities, sought to enhance its prestige by incorporating these relics.
                  But do these inscriptions still serve that purpose today, or are they overlooked by passers-by?
                  This project aims to answer that question.
                  I will first present three epigraphs from the ancient city of <em>Altinum</em> and share their stories. I will also discuss the results of a survey I conducted among passers-by, using the findings to explore how much these inscriptions remain present in the modern collective imagination.</p>

                    <h2>The inscription of Fronto</h2>
                    <p>
                        The epigraph was recorded in the 16th century in the church of San Vidal, where it remains to this day, partly embedded in the church tower and partly visible on its exterior.
                        Cnaeus Numerius Fronto was a horseman (eques) who served in the Roman military and was honorably discharged (honesta missio). After his service, he became a veteran (veteranus) and was granted an estate in Altinum. In this city, he built a successful career, rising to become one of its most prominent politicians.
                        Fronto entrusted his burial arrangements to his three freedmen (liberti): Cnaeus Numerius Felix, Crescens, and Tuendus. You might notice that Fronto and Felix share the same first two names—this was a common Roman practice, as freed slaves often took their former master’s name. Felix serves as an excellent example of Roman social mobility: once a slave, he not only gained his freedom but also held an important position for a freedman, allowing him to organize the city’s games and shows. These events, typically funded by the organizer, earned them public esteem and social recognition. Felix must have been quite wealthy to undertake such a role.
