                          Roman epigraphy is an intriguing legacy of the Roman civilization.
                          Whereas historiography often focuses on the great men who shaped history, inscriptions, on the other hand, reveal a broader reality. They provide a glimpse into the lives of ordinary people and local communities.
                          The men who commissioned these inscriptions often wanted to immortalize their achievements, taking pride in listing their position and/or the regiment they had served in. With just a few lines, we can reconstruct the history of a person and their life.
                          Ancient Roman inscriptions are usually found in ancient cities, but some can also be found in Venice, even though the city itself was born in the Middle Ages! Why is that?

                          This is a question that many scholars have wondered about. The phenomenon of reuse is very old, but in this case, the shortage of raw materials does not seem to be the main reason. This is suggested by the fact that the inscriptions were often placed in plain sight on the walls of buildings. It’s likely that Venice, lacking the ancient past of many other Italian cities, sought to enhance its prestige by incorporating these relics.
                          But do these inscriptions still serve that purpose today, or are they overlooked by passers-by?
                          This project aims to answer that question.
                          I will first present three epigraphs from the ancient city of <em>Altinum</em> and share their stories. I will also discuss the results of a survey I conducted among passers-by, using the findings to explore how much these inscriptions remain present in the modern collective imagination.

                        <h2>The inscription of Fronto</h2>
                        <p>
                            The epigraph was recorded in the 16th century in the church of San Vidal, where it remains to this day, partly embedded in the church tower and partly visible on its exterior.
                            Cnaeus Numerius Fronto was a horseman (eques) who served in the Roman military and was honorably discharged (honesta missio). After his service, he became a veteran (veteranus) and was granted an estate in Altinum. In this city, he built a successful career, rising to become one of its most prominent politicians.
                            Fronto entrusted his burial arrangements to his three freedmen (liberti): Cnaeus Numerius Felix, Crescens, and Tuendus. You might notice that Fronto and Felix share the same first two names—this was a common Roman practice, as freed slaves often took their former master’s name. Felix serves as an excellent example of Roman social mobility: once a slave, he not only gained his freedom but also held an important position for a freedman, allowing him to organize the city’s games and shows. These events, typically funded by the organizer, earned them public esteem and social recognition. Felix must have been quite wealthy to undertake such a role.

                        <h2>The inscription of Faustus</h2>
                        <p>
                            The altar, referenced in 18th-century manuscripts, is said to have originated from Altino. It has remained in a building near the church of Santa Maria Formosa to this day.
                            Unfortunately, the upper section of the altar is not visible, making it impossible to confirm whether it features the typical recess of an altar-ossuary. Such recesses were where Romans would honor their deceased relatives with offerings, libations, or sacred objects, even after death.
                            This monument also involves freedmen. However, unlike other cases, the former master, though mentioned, plays no significant role in this burial. Instead, a single freedman took it upon himself, at his own expense, to commemorate two of his former comrades, all of whom had shared the same master. This monument is particularly intriguing as it highlights the affection and solidarity that could exist among former slaves, even after their emancipation.

                        <h2>The inscription of Acilius</h2>
                        <p>
                            Acilius was undoubtedly a prominent figure in the elite society of Altino, a fact highlighted by his title of decurio, designating him as a member of the local senate. However, the timing of his ascent to this role is intriguing; evidence suggests he likely obtained this prestigious office only after the monument’s construction, as the term decurio seems to have been a later addition to the inscription. This detail hints at an evolving family legacy, with the monument standing as a testament to their growing influence in the community.
                            The funerary urn itself, later repurposed by the Venetians as a baptismal font, reflects both the piety and the aspirations of Acilius. He dedicated it to his father, mother, and brother, creating a lasting tribute that would endure for centuries. The inscription further reveals the existence of a grand rectangular funerary enclosure, measuring an impressive 35 meters per side. Such dimensions are extraordinary, not only in Altino but across the Roman Empire, positioning it among the largest known enclosures of its kind.
                            This scale speaks volumes about the family’s affluence and ambition. It would have served as a powerful statement of their status, ensuring that their memory was preserved within the fabric of Altino’s social and physical landscape. Today, the urn and its inscription offer us a rare glimpse into the interplay of personal devotion, familial pride, and civic prominence in the life of a Roman elite."
                            This version enriches the narrative by weaving in historical context and emphasizing the symbolic importance of the monument. It also adds a touch of storytelling to make it more engaging.
